# slack-my-cookie

Slack My Cookie is design to give cookie (rewards) to users on your slack.

It's more a gamification than something accurate of course.

* First you have to create a slack command to get your token https://api.slack.com/slash-commands
* Then create a webhook to get your URL https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
* Then upload this file in a folder in your WordPress website (yes actually WP is loaded, standalone coming)
* Done

# Usage
	/cookie @someone // Will give a :cookie: to @someone

	/cookie top @someone // Will display (only for you) the top 10 of @someone
	/cookie top something_without_spaces // Will display (only for you) the top 10 of this word
